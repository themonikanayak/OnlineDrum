# Online Drum Kit
May, 2021

• Developed a Drum-Kit Website for Drum lovers.

• It has several buttons with letters and background images of each drum type. When a button is clicked, the corresponding sound is heard with an animation on the button that lasts for 0.1 sec. This sound and animation is also seen when the key of the letter is pressed on the keyboard.

• Used advance JavaScript i.e The Document Object Model and HTML,CSS to create the website.
